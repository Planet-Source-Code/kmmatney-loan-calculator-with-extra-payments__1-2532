## Loan Calculator with Extra Payments


</div>

### Description

This code shows how to calculate loan payments and amortized payments over a fixed amount of time. It allows the user to include an additional payment, either as a fixed amount of extra principal, or as a fixed payment over the P+I)

It is based on an old VB 3.0 example, but improved to include the extra payment capability. It also calculates how much money is saved with the extra payment included.
 
### More Info
 
I also have an Excel spreadsheet which performs the same calculations, but lets you include a different amount of extra payment each month.
